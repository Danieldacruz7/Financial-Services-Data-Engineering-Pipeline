"""
This code simulates a source providing transactional data on a credit card account
for select set of customers, whose ID's range from 1000-1100.
NOTE:
- The output files' contents are always the same (to assist us with checking 
your ETL outputs and dashboards aligns with our expected results). You can disable 
this function if comment out the line: "random.seed(42)"
- You can create more batches of data (to simulate more epochs of transactional
data landing) by increasing the the main for-loop's range.
HINT: there are no transactional UUIDs.
