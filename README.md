# Financial-Services-Data-Engineering-Pipeline
A project used to automate the Extract-Transform-Load process of financial services data using PySpark.

-- In progress --

Improvements to be made:
- Improve pipeline runtime through more efficient Python code.
- Convert absolute paths to relative paths.
- Need to make code more robust to file name differences to make sure code can generalize well to unknown file types and different names.
- Date reformatting required as well as schema improvements to PySpark dataframes.
